## Simple Web Application Book Notes App
The Book Note App is a web application built using EJS, Axios, Express, Bootstrap, and MySQL. This tech stack allows for a dynamic user experience, enabling users to easily manage their book entries. To enhance the visual appeal of the book listings, the app integrates with the [Book Cover API](https://github.com/w3slley/bookcover-api) to fetch and display book cover images. 

### Features
1. Create a Book Entry
  - Easily add a new book to your collection by providing details such as the isbn-13, title, author, rating, and any comments you want to include.
2. Edit a Book Entry
  - Modify any existing book entry. Update the isbn, title, author, rating, or comment to keep your records current.
3. Delete a Book Entry
  - Remove any book entry from your collection when you no longer need it. This action is permanent, so be sure before you delete!
4. Sort Book Entries
  - Organize your book entries for easier navigation and retrieval using the following sorting options:

    - Sort by Title: Arrange your entries alphabetically based on the book title.
    - Sort by Rating: View your entries in order of their ratings, from highest to lowest.
    - Sort by Recency: See your most recently added.
